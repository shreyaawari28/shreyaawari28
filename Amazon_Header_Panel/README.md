# Practice on Amazon Navigation Bar (HTML + CSS)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **practice implementation of an Amazon-style navigation bar**, created using **HTML and CSS**.

In this project, I focused on building a **realistic header/navbar layout** inspired by Amazon’s website.  
The navbar includes a logo, delivery location section, search bar with icon, account options, orders section, and a cart icon.

The project emphasizes understanding **Flexbox layout**, **icons using Font Awesome**, and precise alignment using CSS — without any JavaScript.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Practice structured HTML layout for a navbar  
- Learn Flexbox for horizontal alignment  
- Use Font Awesome icons in a webpage  
- Understand spacing and alignment in complex layouts  
- Style input fields, dropdowns, and icons  
- Replicate a real-world UI using only HTML & CSS

## 🧠 Features Implemented
- Amazon-style top navigation bar  
- Logo section using background image  
- Delivery location section with location icon  
- Fully styled search bar with dropdown, input, and icon  
- Account & Lists dropdown section  
- Returns & Orders section  
- Shopping cart icon with label  
- Hover border effect on navbar items  
- Layout built using Flexbox

## 🧪 How It Works
The entire navbar is a **flex container** using `display: flex` with `space-evenly` alignment.  
Each section of the navbar is placed inside its own container (`box2`, `box3`, etc.) for modular styling.

Font Awesome icons are used for the **location**, **search**, and **cart** icons.  
Hover effects are applied using a shared `.border` class to replicate Amazon’s UI behavior.

All layout and styling logic is handled using CSS only.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
- No JavaScript functionality  
- Navbar is not responsive for smaller screens  
- Search and dropdowns are non-functional  
- Static UI created for layout practice only  

These limitations are intentional for learning purposes.
